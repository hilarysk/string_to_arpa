# StringToArpa

A simple little Ruby gem that converts strings to [Arpabet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arpabet). 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'string_to_arpa'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install string_to_ipa

## Usage

To convert a string to Arpabet:

```ruby
"yay".to_arpa
=> "jˈeɪ" 
```
If the string isn't in the database, calling `.to_arpa` simply returns the original string.
